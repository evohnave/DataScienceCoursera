#Exploratory Data Analysis Project 01

This is my repository for the first project of Exploratory Data Analysis.

Please see the project instructions in Coursera for the details.
  If you are reading this you are most probably familiar with the assignment, so I don't feel a need to reproduce the assignment directions.  If you really want to read these please see the [ReadMe.md](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/README.md) file in the instructor's repo [here](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1).

I assume that you've downloaded the [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) and unzipped it to a subdirectory of your working directory __./data__.

Download and run my scripts {plot1.r, plot2.r, plot3.r, and plot4.r}.  Each will save a plot#.png to the ./data folder.
